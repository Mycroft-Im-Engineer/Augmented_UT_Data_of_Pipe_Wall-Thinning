## Data Availability Statement

The UT datasets used in this study were originally collected from operating nuclear power plants
owned by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and are subject to confidentiality agreements
due to national security and nuclear safety regulations.
Therefore, the original field measurement data cannot be publicly disclosed.

To support research transparency and enable reproducibility of the proposed methodology,
a processed and augmented UT dataset was generated to address class imbalance during model training.
The shared dataset reflects the same error patterns, data structure, and augmentation strategies
described in the paper, while containing no sensitive plant-specific information.

This dataset is publicly available via Zenodo, with access information provided through this GitHub repository,
and allows independent researchers to reproduce the reported model performance
and conduct further studies on anomaly detection in nuclear plant inspection data.

## Notes

- The dataset is fully anonymized and provided for research purposes only.
- Due to institutional and security policies, the source code and trained models are **not publicly available**.
- Please cite both the paper and the dataset DOI when using this dataset.
